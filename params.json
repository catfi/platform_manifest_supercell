{"name":"Platform manifest supercell","body":"Supercell, the Cloud Platform for Online Game Development\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nProject Overview\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nDeploying an online game service can be a challenging and expensive\r\nendeavor. The cost of maintaining the real-time experience for\r\nend-users easily overruns the budget of many small and medium-sized\r\ngame studios. Because of this, we have spent years to develop a\r\ncomplete MMO cloud computing solution based on patent pending GPU\r\ntechnology. With the high performance network technology, one GPU\r\ncluster can support over 10x the client capacity of current CPU-based\r\nsolutions. This opens the door to more complex game design choices\r\nsuch as smarter AI, real-time physics, crowd simulation, path-finding,\r\nand since game rules are enforced on the cloud - better game cheating protection.\r\nOur cloud computing platform enables more game content to be created with less compromise.\r\n\r\nGame developers can freely augment/enrich their gameworlds without the worry of\r\nperformance degradation and the burden of deployment and hosting.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n* Boost C++ Library v1.47 or later\r\n* NVIDIA CUDA SDK 4.0 or later\r\n* Apache Log4cxx\r\n* Intel Threading Building Block (TBB) 3.0 or later\r\n* OFED 1.5.2 or later\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1.

Supercell, the Cloud Platform for Online Game Development
=========================================================

Project Overview
----------------

Deploying an online game service can be a challenging and expensive
endeavor. The cost of maintaining the real-time experience for
end-users easily overruns the budget of many small and medium-sized
game studios. Because of this, we have spent years to develop a
complete MMO cloud computing solution based on patent pending GPU
technology. With the high performance network technology, one GPU
cluster can support over 10x the client capacity of current CPU-based
solutions. This opens the door to more complex game design choices
such as smarter AI, real-time physics, crowd simulation, path-finding,
and since game rules are enforced on the cloud - better game cheating protection.
Our cloud computing platform enables more game content to be created with less compromise.

Game developers can freely augment/enrich their gameworlds without the worry of
performance degradation and the burden of deployment and hosting.
